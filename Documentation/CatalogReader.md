# Catalog Reader

> **Note:** You must first [initialise the SDK](GettingStarted.md#configure-the-sdk) before using the Catalog Reader.

In order to use the Catalog Reader you must add the following dependency to your Podfile:

`pod 'ETA-SDK/CatalogReader'`

This will automatically add the `ETA-SDK/API` component as a dependency to your project as well.


## Usage

To include the `CatalogReaderView` in your code you must import the header file:

```obj-c 
#import <ETA-SDK/ETA_CatalogReaderView.h>
```



See the [ETA-SDK Example project](ETA-SDK Example) for examples of how to use the Catalog Reader View.
