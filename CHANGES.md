# Change Log

## v5.1

> Minimum supported deployment target is now iOS 13 (previously iOS 12)

This release adds support for the async/await model of concurrency. It changes both the APIClient and TjekAPI objects to become actors.

- `TjekAPI.send(â€¦)` is now an `async` function (though it is still possible to use the callback and Future versions of this function).
- `APIRequest` now no longer has a version tag. If you need to define a new APIRequest, you define the endpoint version by picking the correct `.v2()` or `.v4()` static initializers function.
- `TjekAPI.initialize` will now fatalError if called more than once. In order to re-initialize the API, you must call `await TjekAPI.shared.update(config:)`


## v5.0.3

- Adds opening hours to the `Store_v2` model
- Remove the need for API secret

## v5.0.2

- Fix issue with `getPublications` request where storeIds filter was not being applied properly

## v5.0.1

- Adds a search request & a specific model for offer hotspots 

## v5.0

> This release is not backwards-compatible with the previous versions.

This release sees a major overhaul of the structure of the SDK, to modularize it so that the separate components can be loaded independently. It also adds full support for Swift Package Manager.

### v4 -> v5 migration

A number of types and functions have been renamed, while others have stayed the same.

- `ShopGunSDK` is now `TjekSDK`:
	- Use `import TjekSDK` instead of `import ShopGunSDK`.
	- `ShopGunSDK-Config.plist` is now `TjekSDK-Config.plist`, and the structure of the file has been flattened (see the Examples projects).
	- Previously you had to call `PagedPublicationView.configure()` to initialize the SDK. Now you need to call `TjekSDK.initialize()`.

- `CoreAPI` has been replaced with `TjekAPI`:
	- To send a request you now use `send(_:)` on a `TjekAPI` instance, instead of `request(_:)` on a `CoreAPI` instance.
	- All the model objects from `CoreAPI` have been renamed to `<ModelObject>_v2`, and some of their properties have been adjusted/unified slightly.
	- We have added a number of `*_v4` model objects too, which are accessible view v4 api requests.
	- `ImageURLSet` has been replaced with `Set<ImageURL>` for more flexibility.

- Both `IncitoLoaderViewController` and `PagedPublicationView` are now included in the same library: `TjekPublicationViewer`. This is imported by default when importing `TjekSDK`.
	- `IncitoLoaderViewController` is unchanged (apart from now using TjekAPI instead of the old GraphAPI).
	- `PagedPublicationView` is unchanged (apart from now using TjekAPI under the hood).

**Carthage** support has been removed. 
> Due to the addition of SPM support, and the amount of work needed to continue supporting this dependency manager, along with a number of technical hurdles, we have decided to drop support. We recommend you use the Swift Package Manager instead. If anyone wishes to add support, we will gladly accept a PR.
