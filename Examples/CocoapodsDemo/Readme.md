# TjekSDK

## Cocoapods Demo

In order to build this demo you need to first install all the dependant pods:

```
$ cd Examples/CocoapodsDemo/
$ pod install
```

If you have previously built a different dependency demo, you must first clean your build folder.

> Note: For the demo to run correctly you must also supply valid keys to the `TjekSDK-Config.plist` file in the SharedSource folder. You can sign up for a free [here](https://etilbudsavis.dk/developers).
